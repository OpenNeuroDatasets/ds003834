This dataset contains the raw data associated with the paper *Shared neural codes for visual and semantic information about familiar faces in a common representational space* by Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello,
James V. Haxby, and M. Ida Gobbini published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Fourteen subjects performed a 1-back repetition detection task on faces of personally familiar identities and visually familiar identities over two scanning sessions. Hyperalignment was used to functionally align their data based on a movie dataset, "The Grand Budapest Hotel".

Sample code for the analyses is available at https://github.com/mvdoc/identity-decoding. Additional behavioral data is available at https://osf.io/ehygz/.

For more information, see the corresponding paper at XXX. 

The Grand Budapest Hotel data is available at https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003017/. See also the associated paper: Visconti di Oleggio Castello, M., Chauhan, V., Jiahui, G., & Gobbini, M. I.
